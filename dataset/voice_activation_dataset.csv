n26.wav,"life isn’t always easy. We all face challenges, setbacks, and moments when giving up feels like the only option. But it's in those very moments that our true strength is tested. You see, diamonds are made under pressure. Trees grow stronger in the wind. And we, as people, grow the most when we’re pushed beyond our comfort zone. Hard times don’t last — but the strength you gain from them does. So when the road gets tough, don’t quit. Pause if you must, breathe, reflect, and then keep going. Because every step forward, no matter how small, brings you closer to a stronger, wiser version of yourself. Thank you.",negative
n27.wav,"Today, I stand before you not as a student, not as a speaker… but as a professional procrastinator. Yes, while others were doing their work on time, I was mastering the art of last-minute panic typing at 2 a.m. with one eye open and coffee as my co-pilot. And guess what? I still got it done. Mostly. They say procrastination is bad. I say it's time management with flair. Why work 5 days on an assignment when you can feel alive for 5 hours the night before the deadline?",negative
